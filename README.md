LCN Implementation is taken from https://github.com/dibyadas/Visualize-Normalizations

## Notes:

- ASGD Works best among all optimizers for me for Learning Rate : 10^-2  
- Class imbalance is removed prior to training by duplicating the data 
- Learning Rate Decay worsenes the performance  
- Data Augmentation, in general, decreases performance although Spatial Transformer model ensures augmentation isn't a problem. 
- Architecture is changed slighlty from the  original set of layers 
- Currently Gaussian filter is kept constant for LCN, where as ideally it should be chosed at random during run-time  


Neural Net gives output of 6 neurons necessary for Affine transformation (translation, **cropping, rotation, scaling, and skewing)** and uses grid generator and sampling as inbuilt Pytorch commands
